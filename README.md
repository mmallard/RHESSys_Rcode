# RHESSys_Rcode
This is a collection of R scripts to perform analyses of the RHESSys hydrology model.  It is designed to enable the user to:
1) Read various types of input and output files from the model and
2) Calculate basic metrics of model performance (e.g., hydrographs, Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency)

It was developed using R version 3.1.1.  Some scripts require the use of other R libraries and this is noted in the scripts themselves.
